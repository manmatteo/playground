# fpc-cic

Foundational proof certificates in the Calculus of Constructions, with positive and negative sorts.

The test.elpi file contains some examples and outputs synthesised terms in LaTeX format.
The full test suite can be run with `elpi test.elpi -test`, and the output code can be
built with the `proofsystem_macros.sty` macros provided in this directory.

An example output file produced by a test run is `example_output.tex`
